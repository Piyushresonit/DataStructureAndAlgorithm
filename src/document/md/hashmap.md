# HashMap    

> A HashMap is a data structure that is used to store and retrieve values based on keys.
> Backing data structure - **Hash Table + Array**

* **Fast access time**: HashMaps provide constant time access to elements, which means that **retrieval** and **insertion** of elements are very fast, usually **O(1) time complexity**.
* **Allow duplicate Values**: HashMaps allow for duplicate values, but not duplicate keys. 
If a duplicate key is added, the previous **value** associated with the key is **overwritten**.
* **Null Insertion Allowed** : Allows 1 null key and many null values: This means that a null key can be used to store a value, and a null value can be associated with a key.
* **Ordered not followed**: HashMaps are not ordered, which means that the order in which elements are added to the map is not preserved. However, LinkedHashMap is a variation of HashMap that preserves the insertion order.
* **Uses hashing function**: HashMaps uses a hash function to **map keys to indices in an array**. 
This allows for a **quick lookup** of values based on keys.
* Stores **key-value pairs**: Each element in a HashMap consists of a key-value pair. 
The key is used to look up the associated value.
* **Thread-unsafe** or **Non-synchronized**: HashMaps are not thread-safe, which means that if multiple threads access the same hashmap simultaneously, it can lead to data inconsistencies. 
If thread safety is required, ConcurrentHashMap can be used.
* Use `Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap())` to get synchronized HashMap.
* Implements **Serializable** and **Cloneable** interfaces.
* **Capacity and load factor**: HashMaps have a capacity, which is the number of elements that it can hold, and a **load factor**, which is the measure of how full the hashmap can be before it is resized.
* The initial default capacity of HashMap is 16, and default load factor is 0.75.
* When HashMap elements count exceed this threshold, HashMap is resized and new capacity is double the previous capacity.
> Threshold = (DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR * DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY).
* Best Choice: **Fast retrieval**

### Hashing
 
* Hashing is a process of converting an object into integer form by using the method hashCode(). 
* Itâ€™s necessary to write the hashCode() method properly for better performance of HashMap. 
> HashMap also allows a **null** key, so **hash code of null will always be 0**.

### `hashCode() `

* `hashCode()` is used to get the hash code of an object. 
* Returns the memory reference of an object in integer form. 
* Definition of `hashCode()` is `public native hashCode()`. It indicates the implementation of `hashCode()` is native because there is not any direct method in java to fetch the reference of the object. 
* It is possible to provide your implementation of `hashCode()`.  
* In HashMap, `hashCode()` is used to calculate the `bucket index`. 
	
### `equals()` 
* Used to check whether 2 objects are equal or not provided by the Object class.  
* You can override this in your class to provide your implementation.  
* HashMap uses `equals()` to **compare** the **key** to whether they are equal or not.  
* If the `equals()` method return true, they are equal otherwise not equal. 

```java
public Employee(String name){
    this.name = name;
}

@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
    Employee employee = (Employee) o;
    return Objects.equals(name, employee.name);
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(name); // calls native hashCode()
}
```

### Buckets
* Bucket is one element of the HashMap array. 
* It is used to **store nodes**. 
* Two or more nodes can have the same bucket. 
* In that case, a `LinkedList` structure is used to connect the nodes. 
* Buckets are different in capacity.
* A single bucket can have more than one node, it depends on the `hashCode()` method.
* The better your `hashCode()` is, the better your buckets will be utilized.
> Capacity = number of buckets * load factor

### Hash (Index) Calculation in HashMap

* The Hash code of the key may be large enough to create an array. 
* Hash code generated may be in the range of integer and if we create arrays for such a range, then it will easily cause `outOfMemoryException`. 
* So we generate an index to minimize the size of the array.

 The following operation is performed to calculate the index. 
>Index = hashCode(key) % number of bucket

>_WARNING_! if the hashing function is not properly implemented or if the load factor is too high, the performance of a HashMap can degrade.

### Rehash Threshold 
* **Rehashing**: The process of doubling the capacity of the HashMap after it reaches its Threshold.
* It is the product of Load Factor and Initial Capacity.
* In java, by default, it is (16 * 0.75 = 12). 
* That is, Rehashing takes place after inserting 12 key-value pairs into the HashMap.

> **TREEIFY_THRESHOLD** : From Java 8 onward, Java has started using Self Balancing BST instead of a linked list for chaining. The advantage of self-balancing bst is, we get the worst case (when every key maps to the same slot) search time is O(Log n).
